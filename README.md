# Continuous Integration of an iOS App with Travis CI

This repository is an example used in part of the post [Integraci√≥n Continua de una App iOS con Travis CI](http://enmilocalfunciona.io/integracion-continua-de-una-app-ios-con-travis-ci/) from the blog enmilocalfunciona.io (post is in Spanish).

You can see [two closed pull requests](https://github.com/atSistemas/ios-travis-example/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) on atSistemas repository. Travis built both, one of which was successful while the other was not.
